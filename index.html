                <h1>Our Charity</h1>
                <p>All In was founded in 2000 by the Donaldson family. Their inspiration for starting the organization can be traced back to the many people who helped their family after their father, Harold, was killed by a drunk driver in 1969. Today, more than 163 million people have been served throughout the world by All In. We are proud that we work through churches, businesses, government agencies, and other nonprofits to provide help and hope to those who are impoverished, hungry, and hurting.</p>
